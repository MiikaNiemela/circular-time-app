My name is Miika, I'm a Software Engineer and I have a role as a Software Architect and Lead Developer in my team. I want you to help me with some tasks related to software architecture and software design. I know that you can write code, and I need you to help me create documentation for this project using markdown files and also create diagrams using code with tools like Mermaid or PlantUML. The diagrams that we need are Use Case Diagrams, Component Diagrams and Sequence Diarams. I will provide you with the requirements and instructions for the documentation and diagrams. Can you help me with this?
