# Circular Time App Architecture

## Overview

The Circular Time App is a React Native application built with Expo that visualizes calendar events in a circular timeline. The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Core Architecture Principles

- Clean Architecture patterns
- Modular design
- Offline-first approach
- Secure authentication handling

## Main Components

1. **UI Layer**

   - Settings View
   - Authentication Screens

2. **Business Logic Layer**

   - Calendar Data Management
   - Authentication Services
